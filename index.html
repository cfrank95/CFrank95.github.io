        <h1>Bodrum, Turkey</h1>
        <p>While I was in Turkey, I had the opporitunity to visit Bodrum.  Bodrum shares the same waters as Greece, a common tourist attraction.  The hidden gem that is Bodrum is not only beautiful, but affordable.  There are many great places throughout the country, all with their own unique qualities.</p>

        <h2>Why Turkey?</h2>
            <p>Like I've said, I have had the opporitunity to travel all across Europe, spent over a year in Romania alone.  Why am I so stuck on Turkey?  Well, I was travelling with a mutual business partner of Barrack's to go visit his shop in Istanbul, the capital and heart of Turkey.  As soon as I landed, the history behind every wall was apparent, and the hospitality was beyond compare.  The people I met in Turkey are more than just business partners, they have become family to me.  Now, during the summers I travel to Istanbul to work with Barrack selling exotic, handmade jewelry, handbags, and carpets.  This specific dinner took place towards the end of my last trip, we were serenaded with violins and other traditional instrument.  Video seen on <a href="more.html">More Page.</a></p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p> My Name is Chris Frank.  I am a freshman at FGCU.  My major is Software Engineering.  Before coming to FGCU, I spent 4 years in the Marine Corps and travelled across Europe and deployed to areas throughout Africa.</p>
          <p> My goal at FGCU is to learn as much as possible pertaining to programming.  My specific area of interest is artificial intelligence.  I have been interested in that field since I was a kid programming on a game called Roblox.  One day I would love to be on the SpaceX team that sends the first humans to Mars. </p>
